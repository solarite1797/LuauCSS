Merry christmas (idk i lost track of dates) if you're reading this :)

**Disclaimer: Development was started before I started tracking devlogs.**

# 12/21/21

* Added *3* new commands:
* *   grid: \<bool\>;
* *   grid-padsize: \<int\>;
* *   grid-cellsize: \<int\>;

* Fixed a bug where selectors would only select one object with the specified ID
